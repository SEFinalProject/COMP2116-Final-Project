# COMP2116-Final-Project
#The type of software development process:Agile
#Reason to choose:
#1.Flexible requirement changes: The initial core requirements are clear (movement, collision detection, scoring), but frequent adjustments to details (speed control, U optimization) are required during the development process
#2.Small team collaboration: 3-person teams can iterate quickly and synchronize progress on a daily basis
#3.Short term delivery verification: Complete a runnable version every week (including basic logic, interface optimization, and feature expansion)
#4.The waterfall model is not applicable: the requirements are fixed and the stages are strict, making it difficult to adapt to the rapid iteration requirements of course projects

#Usage:
#1.Main users: casual gamers, programming learners
#2.Usage scenario:
##1)Educational purpose: To demonstrate event driven programming and collision detection algorithms
##2)Entertainment use: Lightweight desktop games, suitable for fragmented time
